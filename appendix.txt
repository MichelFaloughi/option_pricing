To do:
    - change build_option_tree in OptionPricer cause when it's a knock-in barrier option, there are two trees not one...
    - see how we can encapsulate the backtrack logic, and the normal european and american pricing
    
Testing:

    BiniomialTree:
        - Test the display works for many depths and values of many digits
    
    StockTree:
        - yeah just test stuff cuh


Optimizations:
    - assertions for the arbitrage conditions (in american options also)
    - add other payoff functions like sqrt, square, or whatever



Conventions:
    - How to label the node height and depth....


Questions:
    - Can depth be 0 ? What's the relationship between depth and N
    - type is a keyword in python, should I use Type instead?
